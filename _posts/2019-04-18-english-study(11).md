오늘은 연습가이드#7 "look, look like, almost look as if, it was clear, judging by" 에 대해서 강의를 들었다.

방금 여기 오는길에,
Just before(now), on my way here, 
혼자서 방황하는 개를 봤어.
I saw a dog (that was) wondering around by itself.

<br>*I saw a man smoking. I saw a woman holding a baby. There were children playing in the park.

<br>굉장히 지저분해 보였어.
It looked really dirty. 
*This feels heavy. Be 동사 대신 지각동사활용.

<br>몇달은 못 씻은것처럼 보였어. 
It looked like it hadn't washed (taken a bath) in several months. It looked like 는 과거 못씻은것은 더 과거 그래서 it hadn't washed 로 과거완료로 사용됨.
보나마나 주인도 없는 개였는데,
It was pretty clear (that) it didn't have an owner. 
가장 최악이었던것은 애가 너무 마른거야. 
The worst thing(part) was that the dog was so thin(skinny). 
가죽이랑 뼈밖에 안남은것처럼 보였다니깐요.
It almost looked like( as if ) it had nothing left but its skin and bones. 
대충 크기나 그런걸로봐서는, 꽤 어렸던 것 같아요. 
Roughly(대충) judging by (~로 봐서는) its size and everything, I think it was pretty young.﻿
