오늘은 expect를 표현하는 방법에 대해서 강의를 들었다.



기대하다. 기대가된다. 들뜬마음 expect(x절대)

1. 좋은 일이 있을거라는 들뜬 마음에서 비롯되는 '기대'

   ex) 감탄형태, 나의 기대감

   (Oh!) I can't wait.

   - can't wait + to <....>  빨리 ~하고 싶다. 간절히 바라는 마음

     I can't wait to graduate and start making money.

     I can't wait to move out of my parents place.

     I can't wait to get the new iPhone X.

   - look forward to ~ + (something, doing something)

     My parents are really looking forward to meeting my boyfriend.

     I'm so sorry, I know you were really looking forward to it.

     * I was really looking forward to this/that.아쉬움의 표현

2. "예상하다"라는 의미에 더 가까운 '기대', 누군가가 무엇을 ~해주고 ~할꺼라는 기대

   ex)

   You must not / can't / shouldn't expect your parents to do everything for you.

   I was expecting everyone to be(come) on time.

   I don't really expect everyone to agree with me.
